## Data
- [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/) : Contains the MovieLens dataset.

## Data Preprocessing
The dataset is preprocessed to handle duplicates, missing values, and format the data for modeling.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory data analysis is conducted to understand user behavior, movie characteristics, and distribution of ratings.

## Building Models
### Collaborative Filtering
- Implemented k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm for collaborative filtering.
- Utilized Surprise library for model development and evaluation.
- Explored various similarity metrics and hyperparameters to optimize model performance.

### Content-Based Filtering
- Leveraged movie metadata (genres) to develop content-based filtering.
- Utilized TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity for content-based recommendations.
- Addressed the cold-start problem by recommending popular movies for new users.

### Hybrid Approach
- Combined collaborative filtering and content-based filtering for improved recommendation accuracy.
- Developed a hybrid recommendation system that adapts to user preferences and item characteristics.

## Evaluation
- Evaluated model performance using metrics such as RMSE and MAE for collaborative filtering.
- Utilized cross-validation and grid search for hyperparameter tuning.
- Analyzed the strengths and limitations of each recommendation technique.

## Conclusion and Recommendations
### Conclusion
The project successfully developed a movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid approaches. Insights were gained into user behavior, movie characteristics, and recommendation techniques. Challenges such as the cold-start problem were addressed, and various methods to improve recommendation accuracy were explored.

### Recommendations
Based on the findings, recommendations for further improvement include enhancing data quality, exploring advanced techniques, fine-tuning hybrid models and, addressing cold-start challenges.

By implementing these recommendations, the movie recommendation system can be further enhanced to provide a valuable and engaging experience for users.
